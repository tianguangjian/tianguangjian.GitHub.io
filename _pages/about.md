This is Tian Guangjian(Grayson)! I'm currently working in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Hong Kong to conduct machine learning and data minging algrithms research as well as its industry applicaitons in CT and IT business. I'm interested in multi-variate time series clustering/segmentation/classification/regression, sequential data modeling with deep neural networks and mathemtical optimization in machine learning. Send me an email: tianguangjian AT gmail.com if you have questions or like to discuss some technical issues with me.

Here are some papers of mine pushed in the last several years:
